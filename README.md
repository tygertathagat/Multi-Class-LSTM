# Multi-Class-LSTM
This small project here is a Textual Classification of BBC News Data over a decade into one of five categories using LSTM or Long Short-Term Memory, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, designed to address the limitations of traditional RNNs in capturing and learning long-term dependencies in sequential data.
We took the dataset from Kaggle the link is shared here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yufengdev/bbc-fulltext-and-category).
I made use o VS Code for the coding, I suggest you use any of the platform you feel comfortable (eg Jupyer Notebook, Spyder etc)
#**The Data Analysis**
The Data Analysis part we have used two main libraries and they are :
1. Pandas
2. Seaborne
Make sure your IDE has these libraries installed or use !pip to install them from your terminal


#**The Data Preprocessing and Model**

First of all install all of these libraries using !pip in your terminal:
1.Pandas
2.NLTK
3.re
4.genism
5.sklearn
6.keras
7.TensorFlow

We are going to make use of these libraries and their modules for the data preprocessing as well as the model deployment.

Most of the above mentioned libraries are used for various machine learning as well as NLP tasks.
Before diving in straight at the project make sure you learn about how the model is using its functions and the parameters to get the optimum solution here.

We are using ACCURACY as our metric for success or failure.
The code is written in a linbear form so that it is easy to understand, if any errors feel free to raise issues !!!

Have A good one !!!
